Task overview:
- Resolve Firebase initialization warnings (duplicate app and unintended host override) while keeping the static Vercel settings unchanged.
- Fix accessibility notices for dialog content by ensuring titles and descriptions are present or intentionally hidden.
- Replace any binary assets (like .ico) with text-based alternatives (such as SVG) and keep the repo binary-free.
- Update the favicon reference so the file loads successfully in static deployments.
- Confirm the pull request builds a working preview.

Steps to implement:
1) Firebase setup
- In the Firebase initialization module, reuse an existing app if one already exists instead of creating a new default app.
- Apply emulator or host settings only once (or with merge semantics) so Firestore logs do not show host override warnings.

2) Dialog accessibility
- For every dialog content component, ensure a visible or visually hidden title is present so `DialogContent` is paired with a `DialogTitle`.
- Provide either a description block or explicitly wire `aria-describedby` to avoid missing description warnings.

3) Binary-free assets
- Remove binary files from the repo and replace them with text-based equivalents (for example, SVG icons instead of ICOs or PNGs).
- Add or run a simple check that fails if any tracked file appears to be binary.

4) Favicon handling
- Point the HTML head to the new text-based favicon file that lives in the repository.
- Verify the referenced path is correct so the favicon is served (no 404s in the browser console).

5) Vercel/static deploy settings
- Keep `vercel.json` exactly as `{ "cleanUrls": true }` with no additional sections.
- Ensure the project deploys as a static site (no build command, output directory is `.`) so previews work.

Verification before opening the pull request
- Run the binary-file check and confirm it passes.
- Open the app locally, check the browser console for the resolved Firebase warnings, and confirm dialogs show accessible labeling.
- Reload the page to confirm the favicon loads without 404s.
- After committing, open a pull request and verify the Vercel preview succeeds.
